<!-- 3 + 6 -> Expression that produces the value.

Statement - Bigger piece of code. -->

In JavaScript, expressions and statements are fundamental building blocks, but they serve different purposes!

# Expressions

- `Evaluate to a value`: When you run an expression, it calculates and returns a single value. This value could be a number, string, boolean, object, or even another function.

- `Used in various contexts`: Expressions can be used within statements, like assignments (`let result = 2 + 3;`), function calls (`console.log(message);`), or conditional checks (`if (age >= 18) {...}`)

Examples: `5 * 10`, `"Hello, world!"`, `x + y`, `myArray[2]`, `!isComplete`

# Statements

- `Perform actions or control flow`: Statements instruct the program to do something, like creating variables, executing control flow structures (if/else, loops), or calling functions. They don't directly produce a value.

- `Form the backbone of your program`: Statements are typically written on separate lines and end with a semicolon (`;`). A sequence of statements forms the logic and behavior of your code.

Examples: `let name = "Alice";`, `if (loggedIn) { showWelcome(); }`, `for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) { console.log(i); }`

# Key Differences:

- `Purpose`: Expressions calculate and return values, while statements perform actions or control program flow.
- `Output`: Expressions always produce a value, while statements may or may not produce a value.
- `Usage`: Expressions are used within statements, while statements form the main structure of your code.

# Analogy:

Think of expressions like ingredients (numbers, strings, etc.) and statements as recipes (instructions using those ingredients). The ingredients have inherent values, while the recipes use them to create something (like a cake).
