Operator precedence in JavaScript, determines the `order in which operators are evaluated when multiple operators are used in an expression`. Operators with higher precedence are evaluated first.

Here's a summary of operator precedence in JavaScript:

1. Grouping (): Parentheses have the highest precedence. Expressions within parentheses are evaluated first.

2. Member Access `. []`: Member access operators (`.` and `[]`) have the next highest precedence. They are used to access properties and elements of objects and arrays, respectively.

3. Function Call(): Function calls have higher precedence than arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators. After member access, function calls are evaluated.

4. Postfix Increment/Decrement ++ --: Postfix increment and decrement operators have higher precedence than most other operators. They modify the value of the variable after the expression is evaluated.

5. Prefix Increment/Decrement ++ --: Prefix increment and decrement operators also have higher precedence than most other operators. They modify the value of the variable before the expression is evaluated.

6. Unary + - ! ~ typeof void: Unary operators come next. They operate on a single operand and are evaluated right to left.

7. Exponentiation : Exponentiation has higher precedence than multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. It is evaluated right-associative.

8. `Multiplication *, Division /, Modulus %`: Multiplication, division, and modulus operators have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right.

9. Addition +, Subtraction -: Addition and subtraction have the same precedence and are evaluated left to right.

10. Bitwise Shift << >> >>>: Bitwise shift operators have lower precedence than arithmetic operators.

11. Relational < <= > >= in instanceof: Relational operators compare operands and return a boolean value.

12. Equality == != === !==: Equality operators compare operands for equality and return a boolean value.

13. Bitwise AND &: Bitwise AND operator.

14. Bitwise XOR ^: Bitwise XOR (exclusive OR) operator.

15. Bitwise OR |: Bitwise OR operator.

16. Logical AND &&: Logical AND operator.

17. Logical OR ||: Logical OR operator.

18. Conditional (Ternary) ?: Conditional (ternary) operator is evaluated from left to right.

19. Assignment `= += -= *= /= %= <<= >>= >>>= &= ^= |=`: Assignment operators are evaluated right to left.

The precedence order dictates how expressions are parsed and evaluated in JavaScript. Understanding operator precedence helps in writing clear and unambiguous code and can prevent unintended behaviors due to operator interactions.
