# Falsy values

In JavaScript, values that are considered `"falsy"` are those that evaluate to `false` when coerced to a boolean context.

Conversely, values that are not `falsy` are considered `"truthy"` and will evaluate to `true` in boolean contexts.

Here are the six values that are considered falsy in JavaScript:

1. `false`: The boolean value `false` itself is falsy.

2. `null`: The value `null` represents the absence of any object value and is considered falsy.

3. `0`: The number `0` (zero) is falsy when coerced to a boolean.

4. `''`: An empty string, represented by two single quotes `''`, is falsy.

5. `NaN`: The special value `NaN` (Not-a-Number) is falsy.

6. `undefined`: The value `undefined` represents a variable that has been declared but has not been assigned a value. It is also falsy.

Here's an example illustrating truthy and falsy values:

```js
if (false) {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}

if (null) {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}

if (0) {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}

if ("") {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}

if (NaN) {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}

if (undefined) {
  console.log("This won't be executed.");
}
```

In the example above, none of the code inside the `if` blocks will be executed because all the conditions evaluate to `falsy` values.

# Truthy values

In addition to the values listed as falsy, JavaScript considers `all other values as truthy`. This includes:

1. Non-empty Strings: Any string with at least one character is considered truthy.

   ```js
   if ("Hello") {
     console.log("This string is truthy.");
   }
   ```

2. Non-zero Numbers: Any number that is not zero is considered truthy.

   ```js
   if (10) {
     console.log("This number is truthy.");
   }
   ```

3. Objects: Objects, including arrays and other complex data structures, are considered truthy.

   ```js
   if ({ key: "value" }) {
     console.log("This object is truthy.");
   }
   ```

4. Arrays: Arrays, even if they are empty, are considered truthy.

   ```js
   const emptyArr = [];
   if (emptyArr) {
     console.log("truthy.");
   } else {
     console.log("falsy");
   }
   ```

5. Functions: Functions, including function objects, are considered truthy.
   ```js
   if (function () {}) {
     console.log("This function is truthy.");
   }
   ```

These values are evaluated as truthy because they have some form of content or existence, as opposed to the specific values identified as falsy.

Understanding truthy and falsy values is crucial for writing effective conditional statements and handling different data types in JavaScript.
